## Description

This module lets you manage the gssproxy service.  It aims to be comprehensive, modular and flexible.

## Setup

### What gssproxy Affects

This module manages the deployment of the gssproxy package, the service and its configuration.  By design the service expects a primary configuration file and zero or more drop-in service configuration files that are merged as one.  The specifics of how that happens is better documented by the man pages of gssproxy, but suffice it to say, this module embraces that design concept.  It also makes trivial the secure deployment of related keytabs whether for service principals or client principals.

### Setup Requirements

I use r10k and Hiera with eyaml, so that's well supported.

### Beginning with gssproxy

For an entirely data driven setup, you merely need to include the primary class:
```
include 'gssproxy'
```

Then you might have in your Hiera data, something like this YAML (where keytab content would be encrypted by eyaml but is shown mangled here for brevity):
```
gssproxy::debug_level:    2
gssproxy::service_configs:
  80-httpd:
    content: >
      [service/HTTP]
        mechs = krb5
        cred_store = keytab:/etc/gssproxy/http.keytab
        cred_store = ccache:/var/lib/gssproxy/clients/krb5cc_httpd_%U
        euid = apache
        program = /usr/sbin/httpd
  99-nfs-client:
    content: >
      [service/nfs-client]
        mechs = krb5
        cred_store = keytab:/etc/krb5.keytab
        cred_store = ccache:/var/lib/gssproxy/clients/krb5cc_nfs_%U
        cred_store = client_keytab:/var/lib/gssproxy/clients/%U.keytab
        cred_usage = initiate
        allow_any_uid = yes
        trusted = yes
        euid = 0
gssproxy::client_keytabs:
  # This keytab authorizes the apache (uid=48) user principal to access NFS
  # shares mounted with 'sec=krb5'.
  '48':
    content: >
      ENC[PKCS7...........]
gssproxy::service_keytabs:
  # This keytab authorizes user principals to access locations served by httpd
  # which are protected by GSSAPI.
  http:
    content: >
      ENC[PKCS7...........]

```

### Classes

#### gssproxy class

This class manages the package deployment.

##### `packages` (required)
An array of package names needed for the gssproxy installation.  The default should be correct for supported platforms.

##### `services` (required)
An array of service names that comprise the gssproxy installation.  The default should be correct for supported platforms.

##### `debug_level`
Detail level at which to log debugging messages.  `0` corresponds to no logging, while `1` turns on basic debug logging.  Level `2` increases verbosity, including more detailed credential verification.  At level `3` and above, KRB5_TRACE output is logged.

##### `client_dir`
Absolute path where client keytab files are to be deployed.

##### `client_keytabs`
A hash whose keys are keytab filenames and whose values are hashes comprising the same parameters you would otherwise pass to the [gssproxy::client\_keytab](#gssproxyclient_keytab-defined-type) defined type.  The default is to deploy none.

##### `config_dir`
Absolute path where service configuration/keytab files are to be deployed.

##### `service_configs`
A hash whose keys are service names and whose values are hashes comprising the same parameters you would otherwise pass to the [gssproxy::service\_config](#gssproxyservice_config-defined-type) defined type.  The default is to deploy none.

##### `service_keytabs`
A hash whose keys are keytab filenames and whose values are hashes comprising the same parameters you would otherwise pass to the [gssproxy::service\_keytab](#gssproxyservice_keytab-defined-type) defined type.  The default is to deploy none.


### Defined types

#### gssproxy::client\_keytab defined type

This defined type manages a client keytab file for the gssproxy service.

##### `namevar` (required)
An arbitrary identifier for the file instance unless the *filename* parameter is not set in which case this must provide the value normally set with the *filename* parameter.

##### `content`, `source`
Literal content for the file or a source URI that provides the same.  If neither *content* nor *source* is given, the content of the file will be left unmanaged.

##### `ensure`
Instance is to be `'present'` (default) or `'absent'`.  Alternatively, a Boolean value may also be used with `true` equivalent to `'present'` and `false` equivalent to `'absent'`.

##### `filename`
Name to be given to the client keytab file, without any path details nor a `.keytab` suffix.  This may be used in place of *namevar* if it's beneficial to give *namevar* an arbitrary value.


#### gssproxy::service\_config defined type

This defined type manages a drop-in service configuration file for the gssproxy service.

##### `namevar` (required)
An arbitrary identifier for the file instance unless the *service_name* parameter is not set in which case this must provide the value normally set with the *service_name* parameter.

##### `content`, `source`
Literal content for the file or a source URI that provides the same.  If neither *content* nor *source* is given, the content of the file will be left unmanaged.

##### `ensure`
Instance is to be `'present'` (default) or `'absent'`.  Alternatively, a Boolean value may also be used with `true` equivalent to `'present'` and `false` equivalent to `'absent'`.

##### `service_name`
Name to be given to the drop-in service configuration file, without any path details nor a `.conf` suffix.  Specifically, the value must conform to the [Gssproxy::ServiceName](#gssproxyservicename-data-type) data type.  This may be used in place of *namevar* if it's beneficial to give *namevar* an arbitrary value.


#### gssproxy::service\_keytab defined type

This defined type manages a service keytab file for the gssproxy service.

##### `namevar` (required)
An arbitrary identifier for the file instance unless the *filename* parameter is not set in which case this must provide the value normally set with the *filename* parameter.

##### `content`, `source`
Literal content for the file or a source URI that provides the same.  If neither *content* nor *source* is given, the content of the file will be left unmanaged.

##### `ensure`
Instance is to be `'present'` (default) or `'absent'`.  Alternatively, a Boolean value may also be used with `true` equivalent to `'present'` and `false` equivalent to `'absent'`.

##### `filename`
Name to be given to the service keytab file, without any path details nor a `.keytab` suffix.  This may be used in place of *namevar* if it's beneficial to give *namevar* an arbitrary value.


### Data types

#### `Gssproxy::ServiceName` data type

Matches acceptable values for naming gssproxy drop-in configuration files.  Valid values are strings beginning with two digits and a dash, followed by one or more characters consisting only of digits, letters and the underscore character.  The two-digit prefix affects the order in which gssproxy will read the drop-in configuration files.
